In this notebook, I explore certain in-game features that contribute to my win matches
## Introduction
Dota2 is a strategic game in which two teams(Radiant vs Dire) will play against each other in a match. Each team consists of 5 players that will have to work together to take the best use of the in-game resources to win the match. In order for a team to win a match, they will have to destroy the opposing team's ancient throne before theirs gets destroyed by their opponents. Each player will play the game using one of the heroes in a pool of about 128 heroes (there might have been more added heroes now, that's why I give an estimate here). Each hero has their own set of abilities that could assist players in achieving their ultimate goal of destroying their opponents' ancient throne. 
## Opendota data
[Opendota](https://blog.opendota.com/2014/08/01/faq/) is a open source platform that provides Dota2 data. It provides web developer with an API to build their own applications. Data is collected by opendota through Steam WebAPI as well as parsing replay files.
