In this notebook, I explore certain in-game features that contribute to my win matches
## Introduction
Dota2 is a strategic game in which two teams(Radiant vs Dire) will play against each other in a match. Each team consists of 5 players that will have to work together to take the best use of the in-game resources to win the match. In order for a team to win a match, they will have to destroy the opposing team's ancient throne before theirs get destroyed by their opponents. Each player will play the game using one of the heroes in a pool of about 128 heroes (there might have been more added heroes now, that's why I give an estimate here). Each hero has their own set of abilities that could assist players in achieving their ultimate goal of destroying their opponents' ancient throne.
